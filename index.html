	<h1>Greetings and Salutations</h1>
	<p>Good day to you all, my fine gentlemen and gentlewomen. It is my hope to indulge you with entertainment and popcorn, for what is a good show without a snack?</p>
	<h2>Last night I had a strange dream.</h2>
	<p>In the recesses of my drowsy mind, I was flipping through candid photographs of drunken festivities.</p>
	<h3>But here's something strange:</h3>
	<p>In each of these photos was a person who had caught the eye of the camera just as it blinked. It seemed as if they were not part of the moment, but rather had <em>transcended</em> the millisecond restriction of the snapshot.</p>
	<h5>*Discuss and interpret amongst yourself as you will.</h5>
	<aside> Vianka is a wanderer in both her stream of consciousness and of unconsciousness. Disorganized as she may be, she really likes to organize.</aside>
